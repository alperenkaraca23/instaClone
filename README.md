# Instagram Clone

Instagram Clone is a simplified version of Instagram, where users can log in, view a feed of photos, upload their own photos, and access settings. The app utilizes **Firebase** for authentication, database storage, and image uploading.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in or sign up using Firebase Authentication.
- **Feed Page**: Displays a list of photos, captions, and like buttons retrieved from the Firebase Cloud Database.
- **Photo Upload**: Allows users to upload photos with captions, which are saved to the Firebase Cloud Database.
- **Settings Page**: Includes a logout button to allow users to sign out of the app.
- **Data Display**: Displays uploaded data in the feed, sorted by the date it was added.

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Integrated **Firebase Authentication** to handle user sign-in and sign-up processes.
   - Created a login page where users can either sign in or sign up with their email and password.
   - If a user is already logged in, they are automatically redirected to the feed page.

2. **Feed Page**:
   - Designed a custom **feed cell** that displays a photo, caption, and like button.
   - Fetched data from **Firebase Cloud Firestore** and displayed the content (photos, captions, and user info) in the feed, sorted by the date of the post.

3. **Photo Upload**:
   - Created a page where users can upload a photo with a caption.
   - When the user uploads a photo, the image is saved to Firebase Storage, and the caption along with the userâ€™s email and upload date is saved in Firebase Cloud Firestore.

4. **Settings Page**:
   - Designed a settings page with a **logout button**, allowing users to sign out of the app and return to the login page.

5. **Firebase Integration**:
   - Used **Firebase** for both authentication (sign in, sign up) and database management (storing user data, photos, and captions).
   - Used **Firebase Storage** to store the images and **Firestore** to store user-related data and photo captions.

6. **Navigation**:
   - Implemented **segues** to smoothly navigate between pages, including from the login page to the feed page and from the feed page to the upload page.

7. **Testing**:
   - Performed extensive testing to ensure smooth user login, feed display, photo upload, and logout functionality.
