# instaClone

<li> I started this simple clone project by first creating an Instagram login page. </li>
<li> After deciding to use Firebase for authorization and login controls, I wrote the necessary codes. </li>
<li> After doing this, if there is an current user, I added the codes to the scene delegate that will direct them directly to the feed without seeing the login page. </li>
<li> Then I designed a special cell for the feed. I defined my codes so that the cell I designed would be the photo, caption and like button. </li>
<li> I added the codes that display the data I retrieved from the database I created with Firebase, listed by date in the feedcell. </li>
<li> Then, I defined the page required for uploading and integrated it into Firebase. I ensured that the photo to be shared, the date and the user email address were saved in the database. </li>
<li> Finally, I completed my project by creating the settings page into which I added the exit button. </li>
<li> Within the scope of this project, I learned how to use Cloud Database, sign in and sign up processes, navigate between pages easily with segues, save photos that the user will share to this database and recall them in the feed. </li>
